PXE (Pre eXecution Environment), affectionately pronounced Pixie (as in fairy dust), is a method of having an end computer (client) boot using only its network card.

If you regularly install tens or hundreds of PCâ€™s, you can start the installer on all those machines at once without needing to have individual boot/install media for each machine.
